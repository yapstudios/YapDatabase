/**
 * Welcome to YapDatabase!
 *
 * The project page has a wealth of documentation if you have any questions.
 * https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase
 *
 * If you're new to the project you may want to visit the wiki.
 * https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase/wiki
 *
 * The YapDatabase class is the top level class used to initialize the database.
 * It largely represents the immutable aspects of the database such as:
 *
 * - the filepath of the sqlite file
 * - the serializer and deserializer (for turning objects into data blobs, and back into objects again)
 *
 * To access or modify the database you create one or more connections to it.
 * Connections are thread-safe, and you can spawn multiple connections in order to achieve
 * concurrent access to the database from multiple threads.
 * You can even read from the database while writing to it from another connection on another thread.

/**
 * How does YapDatabase store my objects to disk?
 *
 * That question is answered extensively in the wiki article "Storing Objects":
 * https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase/wiki/Storing-Objects
 *
 * Here's the intro from the wiki article:
 *
 * > In order to store an object to disk (via YapDatabase or any other protocol) you need some way of
 * > serializing the object. That is, convert the object into a big blob of bytes. And then, to get your
 * > object back from the disk you deserialize it (convert big blob of bytes back into object form).
 * >
 * > With YapDatabase, you can choose the default serialization/deserialization process,
 * > or you can customize it and use your own routines.
 *
 * In order to support adding objects to the database, serializers and deserializers are used.
 * The serializer and deserializer are just simple blocks that you can optionally configure.
 * The default serializer/deserializer uses NSCoding, so they are as simple and fast:
 *
 * defaultSerializer = ^(NSString *collection, NSString *key, id object){
 *     return [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:object];
 * };
 * defaultDeserializer = ^(NSString *collection, NSString *key, NSData *data) {
 *     return [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithData:data];
 * };
 *
 * If you use the initWithPath initializer, the default serializer/deserializer are used.
 * Thus to store objects in the database, the objects need only support the NSCoding protocol.
 * You may optionally use a custom serializer/deserializer for the objects and/or metadata.
**/
typedef NSData * __nonnull (^YapDatabaseSerializer)(NSString *collection, NSString *key, id object);
typedef id __nullable (^YapDatabaseDeserializer)(NSString *collection, NSString *key, NSData *data);

/**
 * The sanitizer block allows you to enforce desired behavior of the objects you put into the database.
 *
 * If set, the sanitizer block will be run on all items being input into the database via
 * the setObject:forKey:inCollection: (and other setObject:XXX: methods).
 * 
 * You have 2 different hooks for running a sanitizer block:
 *
 * The PreSanitizer is run:
 * - Before the object is serialized
 * - Before the object is stored in the cache
 * - Before the object is passed to extensions
 * 
 * The PostSanitizer is run:
 * - After the object has been serialized
 * - After the object has been stored in the cache
 * - After the object has been passed to extensions
 *
 * The PreSanitizer is generally used validate the objects going into the database,
 * and/or to enforce immutability of those objects.
 *
 * Enforcing immutability is a topic covered in the "Object Policy" wiki article:
 * https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase/wiki/Object-Policy
 *
 * The PostSanitizer is generally used to "clear flags" that are used by extensions.
 * For example, your objects might have a "changedProperties" property that tells extensions exactly
 * what properties where changed on a modified object. And the extension uses that information
 * in order to automatically sync the changes to the cloud. Thus the PostSanitizer would be used
 * to clear the "changedProperties" after the extension has processed the modified object.
 * 
 * An example of such a use for the PostSanitizer is discussed in the YapDatabaseCloudKit wiki article:
 * https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase/wiki/YapDatabaseCloudKit

/**
 * This notification is posted when a YapDatabase instance is deallocated,
 * and has thus closed all references to the underlying sqlite files.
 * 
 * If you intend to delete the sqlite file(s) from disk,
 * it's recommended you use this notification as a hook to do so.
 * 
 * More info:
 * The YapDatabase class itself is just a retainer for the filepath, blocks, config, etc.
 * And YapDatabaseConnection(s) open a sqlite connection to the database file,
 * and rely on the blocks & config in the parent YapDatabase class.
 * Thus a YapDatabaseConnection instance purposely retains the YapDatabase instance.
 * This means that in order to fully close all references to the underlying sqlite file(s),
 * you need to deallocate YapDatabase and all associated YapDatabaseConnections.
 * While this may be simple in concept, it's generally difficult to know exactly when all
 * the instances have been deallocated. Especially when there may be a bunch of asynchronous operations going.
 * 
 * Therefore the best approach is to do the following:
 * - destroy your YapDatabase instance (set it to nil)
 * - destroy all YapDatabaseConnection instances
 * - wait for YapDatabaseClosedNotification
 * - use notification as hook to delete all associated sqlite files from disk
 *
 * The userInfo dictionary will look like this:
 * @{

 *     YapDatabasePathWalKey : <NSString of full filePath to db.sqlite-wal file>,

/**
 * The snapshot number is the internal synchronization state primitive for the database.
 * It's generally only useful for database internals,
 * but it can sometimes come in handy for general debugging of your app.
 *
 * The snapshot is a simple 64-bit number that gets incremented upon every readwrite transaction
 * that makes modifications to the database. Due to the concurrent architecture of YapDatabase,
 * there may be multiple concurrent connections that are inspecting the database at similar times,
 * yet they are looking at slightly different "snapshots" of the database.
 *
 * The snapshot number may thus be inspected to determine (in a general fashion) what state the connection
 * is in compared with other connections.
 *
 * YapDatabase.snapshot = most up-to-date snapshot among all connections
 * YapDatabaseConnection.snapshot = snapshot of individual connection
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * YapDatabase *database = [[YapDatabase alloc] init...];
 * database.snapshot; // returns zero
 *
 * YapDatabaseConnection *connection1 = [database newConnection];
 * YapDatabaseConnection *connection2 = [database newConnection];
 *
 * connection1.snapshot; // returns zero
 * connection2.snapshot; // returns zero
 *
 * [connection1 readWriteWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadWriteTransaction *transaction){
 *     [transaction setObject:objectA forKey:keyA];
 * }];
 *
 * database.snapshot;    // returns 1
 * connection1.snapshot; // returns 1
 * connection2.snapshot; // returns 1
 *
 * [connection1 asyncReadWriteWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadWriteTransaction *transaction){
 *     [transaction setObject:objectB forKey:keyB];
 *     [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:1.0]; // sleep for 1 second
 *
 *     connection1.snapshot; // returns 1 (we know it will turn into 2 once the transaction completes)
 * } completion:^{
 *
 *     connection1.snapshot; // returns 2
 * }];
 *
 * [connection2 asyncReadWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadTransaction *transaction){
 *     [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:5.0]; // sleep for 5 seconds
 *
 *     connection2.snapshot; // returns 1. See why?
 * }];
 *
 * It's because connection2 started its transaction when the database was in snapshot 1.
 * Thus, for the duration of its transaction, the database remains in that state.
 *
 * However, once connection2 completes its transaction, it will automatically update itself to snapshot 2.
 *
 * In general, the snapshot is primarily for internal use.
 * However, it may come in handy for some tricky edge-case bugs (why doesn't my connection see that other commit?)

 * > OK, truth be told they're not really that heavy weight. I'm just trying to scare you.
 * > Because in terms of performance, you get a lot of bang for your buck if you recycle your connections.
 *
 * However, experience has shown how easy it is to neglect this information.
 * Perhaps because it's just so darn easy to create a connection that it becomes easy to forgot
 * that connections aren't free.
 * 
 * Whatever the reason, the connection pool was designed to alleviate some of the overhead.
 * The most expensive component of a connection is the internal sqlite database connection.
 * The connection pool keeps these internal sqlite database connections around in a pool to help recycle them.
 *
 * So when a connection gets deallocated, it returns the sqlite database connection to the pool.
 * And when a new connection gets created, it can recycle a sqlite database connection from the pool.
 * 
 * This property sets a maximum limit on the number of items that will get stored in the pool at any one time.
 * 
 * The default value is 5.
 * 
 * See also connectionPoolLifetime,
 * which allows you to set a maximum lifetime of connections sitting around in the pool.

 * 
 * That is, after an item is added to the connection pool to be recycled, a timer will be started.

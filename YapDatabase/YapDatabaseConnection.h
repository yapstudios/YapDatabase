/**
 * Welcome to YapDatabase!
 *
 * The project page has a wealth of documentation if you have any questions.
 * https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase
 *
 * If you're new to the project you may want to visit the wiki.
 * https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase/wiki
 *
 * From a single YapDatabase instance you can create multiple connections.
 * Each connection is thread-safe and may be used concurrently with other connections.
 * 
 * Multiple connections can simultaneously read from the database.
 * Multiple connections can simultaneously read from the database while another connection is modifying the database.
 * For example, the main thread could be reading from the database via connection A,
 * while a background thread is writing to the database via connection B.
 *
 * However, only a single connection may be writing to the database at any one time.
 * This is an inherent limitation of the underlying sqlite database.
 *
 * A connection instance is thread-safe, and operates by serializing access to itself.
 * Thus you can share a single connection between multiple threads.
 * But for conncurrent access between multiple threads you must use multiple connections.

#pragma mark State
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/**
 * The snapshot number is the internal synchronization state primitive for the connection.
 * It's generally only useful for database internals,
 * but it can sometimes come in handy for general debugging of your app.
 *
 * The snapshot is a simple 64-bit number that gets incremented upon every readwrite transaction
 * that makes modifications to the database. Due to the concurrent architecture of YapDatabase,
 * there may be multiple concurrent connections that are inspecting the database at similar times,
 * yet they are looking at slightly different "snapshots" of the database.
 * 
 * The snapshot number may thus be inspected to determine (in a general fashion) what state the connection
 * is in compared with other connections.
 * 
 * You may also query YapDatabase.snapshot to determine the most up-to-date snapshot among all connections.
 *
 * Example:
 * 
 * YapDatabase *database = [[YapDatabase alloc] init...];
 * database.snapshot; // returns zero
 *
 * YapDatabaseConnection *connection1 = [database newConnection];
 * YapDatabaseConnection *connection2 = [database newConnection];
 * 
 * connection1.snapshot; // returns zero
 * connection2.snapshot; // returns zero
 * 
 * [connection1 readWriteWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadWriteTransaction *transaction){
 *     [transaction setObject:objectA forKey:keyA];
 * }];
 * 
 * database.snapshot;    // returns 1
 * connection1.snapshot; // returns 1
 * connection2.snapshot; // returns 1
 * 
 * [connection1 asyncReadWriteWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadWriteTransaction *transaction){
 *     [transaction setObject:objectB forKey:keyB];
 *     [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:1.0]; // sleep for 1 second
 *     
 *     connection1.snapshot; // returns 1 (we know it will turn into 2 once the transaction completes)
 * } completion:^{
 *     
 *     connection1.snapshot; // returns 2
 * }];
 * 
 * [connection2 asyncReadWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadTransaction *transaction){
 *     [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:5.0]; // sleep for 5 seconds
 * 
 *     connection2.snapshot; // returns 1. See why?
 * }];
 *
 * It's because connection2 started its transaction when the database was in snapshot 1.
 * Thus, for the duration of its transaction, the database remains in that state.
 * 
 * However, once connection2 completes its transaction, it will automatically update itself to snapshot 2.
 *
 * In general, the snapshot is primarily for internal use.
 * However, it may come in handy for some tricky edge-case bugs (why doesn't my connection see that other commit?)

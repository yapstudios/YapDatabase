/**
 * The grouping block handles both filtering and grouping.
 * 
 * When you add or update rows in the database the grouping block is invoked.
 * Your grouping block can inspect the row and determine if it should be a part of the view.
 * If not, your grouping block simply returns 'nil' and the object is excluded from the view (removing it if needed).
 * Otherwise your grouping block returns a group, which can be any string you want.
 * Once the view knows what group the row belongs to,
 * it will then determine the position of the row within the group (using the sorting block).
 * 
 * It is recommended you choose a block type that takes the minimum number of required parameters.
 * This allows the view to make various optimizations based on the required parameters of the block.
 * 
 * If you'd like to get more advanced, you can specify exactly what should trigger an invocation of the block.
 * For example:
 * 
 * If you use a 'GroupingWithObjectBlock', then normally the view will assume that any changes to the 'object' in
 * the database means that the groupingBlock should be re-invoked (to check for changes to the group).
 * However, your groupingBlock may be more "static" than that.
 * That is, it may simply be based on an immutable property of the object.
 * And as such, it only needs to be run once (because the group will never change).
 * So you can use the 'options' parameter to specify YapDatabaseBlockInvokeOnInsertOnly.
 * This will allow the view to properly optimize based on the details of your actual groupingBlock implementation.

/**
 * The sorting block handles sorting of objects within their group.
 *
 * After the view invokes the grouping block to determine what group a database row belongs to (if any),
 * the view then needs to determine what index within that group the row should be.
 * In order to do this, it needs to compare the new/updated row with existing rows in the same view group.
 * This is what the sorting block is used for.
 * So the sorting block will be invoked automatically during this process until the view has come to a conclusion.
 * 
 * You should choose a block type that takes the minimum number of required parameters.
 * The view can make various optimizations based on required parameters of the block.
 * 
 * For example, if sorting is based on the object, and the metadata of a row is updated,
 * then the view can deduce that the index hasn't changed (if the group hans't), and can skip this step.
 * 
 * Performance Note:
 * 
 * The view uses various optimizations (based on common patterns)
 * to reduce the number of times it needs to invoke the sorting block.
 *
 * - Pattern      : row is updated, but its index in the view doesn't change.
 *   Optimization : if an updated row doesn't change groups, the view will first compare it with
 *                  objects to the left and right.
 *
 * - Pattern      : rows are added to the beginning or end or a view
 *   Optimization : if the last change put an object at the beginning of the view, then it will test this quickly.
 *                  if the last change put an object at the end of the view, then it will test this quickly.
 * 
 * These optimizations offer huge performance benefits to many common cases.
 * For example, adding objects to a view that are sorted by timestamp of when they arrived.
 *
 * The optimizations are not always performed.
 * For example, if the last change didn't place an item at the beginning or end of the view.
 *
 * If optimizations fail, or are skipped, then the view uses a binary search algorithm.
 * 
 * Although this may be considered "internal information",
 * I feel it is important to explain for the following reason:
 * 
 * Another common pattern is to fetch a number of objects in a batch, and then insert them into the database.
 * Now imagine a situation in which the view is sorting posts based on timestamp,
 * and you just fetched the most recent 10 posts. You can enumerate these 10 posts either forwards or backwards
 * while adding them to the database. One direction will hit the optimization every time. The other will cause
 * the view to perform a binary search every time.
 * These little one-liner optimzations are easy (given this internal information is known).

/**
 * A find block is used to efficiently find items within a view.
 * It allows you to perform a binary search on the pre-sorted items within a view.
 * 
 * The return values from the YapDatabaseViewFindBlock have the following meaning:
 * 
 * - NSOrderedAscending : The given row (block parameters) is less than the range I'm looking for.
 *                        That is, the row would have a smaller index within the view than would the range I seek.
 * 
 * - NSOrderedDecending : The given row (block parameters) is greater than the range I'm looking for.
 *                        That is, the row would have a greater index within the view than would the range I seek.
 * 
 * - NSOrderedSame : The given row (block parameters) is within the range I'm looking for.
 * 
 * Keep in mind 2 things:
 * 
 * #1 : This method can only be used if you need to find items according to their sort order.
 *      That is, according to how the items are sorted via the view's sortingBlock.
 *      Attempting to use this method in any other manner makes no sense.
 *
 * #2 : The findBlock that you pass needs to be setup in the same manner as the view's sortingBlock.
 *      That is, the following rules must be followed, or the results will be incorrect:
 *      
 *      For example, say you have a view like this, looking for the following range of 3 items:
 *      myView = @[ A, B, C, D, E, F, G ]
 *                     ^^^^^^^
 *      sortingBlock(A, B) => NSOrderedAscending
 *      findBlock(A)       => NSOrderedAscending
 *      
 *      sortingBlock(E, D) => NSOrderedDescending
 *      findBlock(E)       => NSOrderedDescending
 * 
 *      findBlock(B) => NSOrderedSame
 *      findBlock(C) => NSOrderedSame
 *      findBlock(D) => NSOrderedSame
 * 
 * In other words, you can't sort one way in the sortingBlock, and "sort" another way in the findBlock.
 * Another way to think about it is in terms of how the Apple docs define the NSOrdered enums:
 * 
 * NSOrderedAscending  : The left operand is smaller than the right operand.
 * NSOrderedDescending : The left operand is greater than the right operand.
 * 
 * For the findBlock, the "left operand" is the row that is passed,
 * and the "right operand" is the desired range.
 * 
 * And NSOrderedSame means: "the passed row is within the range I'm looking for".

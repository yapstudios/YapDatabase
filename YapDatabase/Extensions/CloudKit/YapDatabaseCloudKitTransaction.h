/**
 * This method is used to associate an existing CKRecord with a row in the database.
 * There are two primary use cases for this method.
 * 
 * 1. To associate a discovered/pulled CKRecord with a row in the database before you insert the row.
 *    In particular, for the following situation:
 *    
 *    - You're pulling record changes from the server via CKFetchRecordChangesOperation (or similar).
 *    - You discover a record that was inserted by another device.
 *    - You need to add a corresponding row to the database,
 *      but you also need to inform the YapDatabaseCloudKit extension about the existing record,
 *      so it won't bother invoking the recordHandler, or attempting to upload the existing record.
 *    - So you invoke this method FIRST.
 *    - And THEN you insert the corresponding object into the database via the
 *      normal setObject:forKey:inCollection: method (or similar methods).
 *
 * 2. To assist in the migration process when switching to YapDatabaseCloudKit.
 *    In particular, for the following situation:
 *
 *    - You've been handling CloudKit manually (not via YapDatabaseCloudKit).
 *    - And you now want YapDatabaseCloudKit to manage the CKRecord for you.
 *    - So you can invoke this method for an object that already exists in the database,
 *      OR you can invoke this method FIRST, and then insert the new object that you want linked to the record.
 * 
 * Thus, this method works as a simple "hand-off" of the CKRecord to the YapDatabaseCloudKit extension.
 *
 * In other words, YapDatbaseCloudKit will write the system fields of the given CKRecord to its internal table,
 * and associate it with the given collection/key tuple.
 * 
 * @param record
 *   The CKRecord to associate with the collection/key tuple.
 * 
 * @param databaseIdentifer
 *   The identifying string for the CKDatabase.
 *   @see YapDatabaseCloudKitDatabaseIdentifierBlock.
 *
 * @param key
 *   The key of the row to associate the record with.
 * 
 * @param collection
 *   The collection of the row to associate the record with.
 * 
 * @param shouldUpload
 *   If NO, then the record is simply associated with the collection/key,
 *     and YapDatabaseCloudKit doesn't attempt to push the record to the cloud.
 *   If YES, then the record is associated with the collection/key,
 *     and YapDatabaseCloutKit assumes the given record is dirty and will push the record to the cloud.
 * 
 * @return
 *   YES if the record was associated with the given collection/key.
 *   NO if one of the following errors occurred.
 * 
 * The following errors will prevent this method from succeeding:
 * - The given record is nil.
 * - The given collection/key is already associated with a different record (so must detach it first).
 * 
 * Important: This method only works if within a readWriteTrasaction.
 * Invoking this method from within a read-only transaction will throw an exception.

/**
 * This method is used to unassociate an existing CKRecord with a row in the database.
 * There are three primary use cases for this method.
 * 
 * 1. To properly handle CKRecordID's that are reported as deleted from the server.
 *    In particular, for the following situation:
 *
 *    - You're pulling record changes from the server via CKFetchRecordChangesOperation (or similar).
 *    - You discover a recordID that was deleted by another device.
 *    - You need to remove the associated record from the database,
 *      but you also need to inform the YapDatabaseCloudKit extension that it was remotely deleted,
 *      so it won't bother attempting to upload the already deleted recordID.
 *    - So you invoke this method FIRST.
 *    - And THEN you can remove the corresponding object from the database via the
 *      normal removeObjectForKey:inCollection: method (or similar methods) (if needed).
 *
 * 2. To assist in various migrations, such as version migrations.
 *    For example:
 * 
 *    - In version 2 of your app, you need to move a few CKRecords into a new zone.
 *    - But you don't want to delete the items from the old zone,
 *      because you need to continue supporting v1.X for awhile.
 *    - So you invoke this method first in order to drop the previous record association(s).
 *    - And then you can attach the new CKRecord(s),
 *      and have YapDatabaseCloudKit upload the new records (to their new zone).
 * 
 * 3. To "move" an object from the cloud to "local-only".
 *    For example:
 * 
 *    - You're making a Notes app that allows user to stores notes locally, or in the cloud.
 *    - The user moves an existing note from the cloud, to local-only storage.
 *    - This method can be used to delete the item from the cloud without deleting it locally.
 * 
 * @param key
 *   The key of the row associated with the record to detach.
 *   
 * @param collection
 *   The collection of the row associated with the record to detach.
 * 
 * @param wasRemoteDeletion
 *   Did the server notify you of a deleted CKRecordID? 
 *   Then make sure you set this parameter to YES.
 *   This allows the extension to properly modify any changeSets that are still queued for upload
 *   so that it can remove potential modifications for this recordID.
 * 
 *   Note: If a record was deleted remotely, and the record was associated with MULTIPLE items in the database,
 *   then you should be sure to invoke this method for each attached collection/key.
 * 
 * @param shouldUpload
 *   Whether or not the extension should push a deleted CKRecordID to the cloud.
 *   In use case #2 (from the above discussion, concerning migration), you'd pass NO.
 *   In use case #3 (from the above discussion, concerning moving), you'd pass YES.
 *   This parameter is ignored if wasRemoteDeletion is YES (in which it will force shouldUpload to be NO).

 * Invoking this method from within a read-only transaction will throw an exception.

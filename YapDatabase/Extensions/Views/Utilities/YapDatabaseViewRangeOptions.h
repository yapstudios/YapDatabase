/**
 * There are 2 types of supported ranges: Fixed & Flexible
 * 
 * A fixed range is similar to using a LIMIT & OFFSET in a SQL query.
 * That is, it represents a designated range that doesn't change.
 * 
 * You create a fixed range by specifying a desired length
 * and an offset from either the beginning or end.
 * 
 * @param length
 *   The desired length of the range.
 *   The length doesn't need to be valid at this point in time.
 *   For example, if the group only has 4 items, you can still specify a length of 20 if that is the desired length.
 *   The mappings will automatically use a length of 4 to start, and automatically expand up to 20.
 * 
 * @param offset
 *   The offset from one either the beginning or end of the group.
 *   
 * @param beginningOrEnd
 *   Either YapDatabaseViewBeginning or YapDatabaseViewEnd.
 * 
 * Using YapDatabaseViewMappings along with a fixed range provides some unique features:
 *
 * - If you specify an offset from the end of the group (YapDatabaseViewEnd),
 *   you are essentially "pinning" the range to the end, and it will stay pinned that way regardless of
 *   inserted or deleted items elsewhere in the group.
 *   
 *   For example: If you pin the range to the end, with an offset of zero, and a length of 20,
 *   then the range will always specify the last 20 items in the group,
 *   even as the group length (as a whole) increases or decreases.
 * 
 * - The changeset processing will automatically create the proper row changes to match what you want.
 *   
 *   For example: You have a fixed range with length 20, pinned to the beginning with an offset of 0,
 *   and a new item is inserted at index 0. The changeset processing will automatically give you a row
 *   insert at index 0, and a row delete at the end of your range to properly account for the row
 *   that got pushed outside your range.
 * 
 *   Thus you get row animations for free, even when only displaying a subset.
 *   And all the math is already done for you.

/**
 * There are 2 types of supported ranges: Fixed & Flexible
 * 
 * A flexible range is designed to grow and shrink.
 * To explain this concept, consider Apple's SMS Messages app:
 *   
 *   When you go into a conversation (tap on a persons name),
 *   the messages app starts by displaying the most recent 50 messages (with the most recent at bottom).
 *   Although there might be thousands of old messages between you and the other person,
 *   only 50 are in the view to begin with.
 *   As you send and/or receive messages within the view, the length will grow.
 *   And similarly, if you manually delete messages, the length will shrink.
 * 
 * Flexible ranges are designed to handle these types of user interfaces.
 * They're also quite customizeable to handle a number of different situations.
 * 
 * You create a flexible range by specifying an starting length
 * and an offset from either the beginning or end.
 *
 * @param length
 *   The desired starting length of the range.
 *   The length doesn't need to be valid at this point in time.
 *   For example, if the group only has 4 items, you can still specify a length of 20.
 *   The mappings will automatically correct the length as appropriate.
 *
 * @param offset
 *   The offset from one either the beginning or end of the group.
 *
 * @param beginningOrEnd
 *   Either YapDatabaseViewBeginning or YapDatabaseViewEnd.

/**
 * GrowOptions ONLY apply to FLEXIBLE ranges.
 * 
 * The growOptions allow you to specify in which direction(s) the range may grow.
 * Let's look at a few concrete examples.
 * 
 * Example #1
 * 
 *   We're using a flexible range, with an offset of zero, pinned to the beginning.
 *   We're displaying news items, and the most recent items get inserted at index 0.
 *   The group currently contains thousands of items, and our range has a starting length of 50.
 *   If a new item gets inserted (at the beginning), we want it to get added to our range.
 *   So we would set our growOptions to be YapDatabaseViewGrowPinSide (this is the default value).
 * 
 * Example #2
 * 
 *   We're using a flexible range, with an offset of zero, pinned to the end.
 *   We're displaying log entries, with the most recent items getting appended to the end.
 *   The group currently contains thousands of items, and our range has a starting length of 50.
 *   If a new log item gets inserted (at the end), we want it to get added to our range.
 *   So we would set our growOptions to be YapDatabaseViewGrowPinSide (this is the default value).
 * 
 * Example #3
 * 
 *   We're making a UI that is somewhat akin to Facebook's news feed.
 *   That is, the most recent items come in at the top,
 *   but if you scroll to the bottom we automatically download older posts.
 *   However, we don't want to limit how far the user can scroll down.
 *   That is, if the user is bored, we're going to allow them to scroll down for
 *   however long we can fetch old items from the server.
 *   But obviously we can't allow the length of our tableView to grow infinitely long.
 *   So to accomplish this, we're going to use flexible ranges,
 *   and we're going to shift the length as the user scrolls down.
 *   To start with, we only have the 30 most recent posts in the database.
 *   And we set our flexible range as: length=30, offset=0, pin=YapDatabaseViewBeginning.
 *   Additionally we set our growOptions to: YapDatabaseViewGrowOnBothSides.
 *   Thus if we download new items, they'll get included in the range.
 *   And if we fetch older items, they'll also get included in the range.
 *   Now as the the user scrolls down, and we fetch more and more old items,
 *   we eventually get to the point were we shift the range.
 *   So when the range length gets to some max length that we want to support, we shift to a new flexible range:
 *   length=max, offset=0, pin=YapDatabaseViewEnd, growOptions=YapDatabaseViewGrowPinSide, maxLength=max
 *   This new range will keep the tableView length capped at max, and continually load older content as it gets fetched.
 *   To allow the user to scroll back up, we just increment the offset as the go.
 *   When they eventually get back up to the top, we reset the flexible range to its original value.
 * 
 *
 * To explain the different options, consider the following picture:
 * 
 *  - - - - -
 * | |x|x|x| |  <-- x marks the range
 *  - - - - -
 *  0 1 2 3 4
 *
 * groupCount = 5
 * flexibleRange: length=3, offset=1, pin=YapDatabaseViewBeginning, growOptions=YapDatabaseViewGrowPinSide
 * 
 * Now an item gets inserted at index 1 as follows:
 * 
 *  - - - - - -
 * | |?|x|x|x| |  <-- is ? added to the flexible range?
 *  - - - - - -
 *  0 1 2 3 4 5
 *
 * Does the item get added to the flexible range (with the given config options)?
 * The answer is YES.
 * 
 *  - - - - - -
 * | |x|x|x|x| |  <-- YES (based on pin & growOptions)
 *  - - - - - -
 *  0 1 2 3 4 5
 *
 * Because the flexible range is pinned to the beginning, and grows pin side.
 * So if anything gets inserted between what was originally at index 0, and what was originally at index 1,
 * then those items get added to the flexible range.
 * 
 * Notice that after the insert, the offset remains set at 1.
 * Notice that the answer would be NO if the flexible range was pinned to the end (with the same growOptions).
 * 
 * Now let's see what happens if something gets inserted at the end:
 * 
 *  - - - - - - -
 * | |x|x|x|x|?| |  <-- is ? added to the flexible range?
 *  - - - - - - -
 *  0 1 2 3 4 5 6
 * 
 * Does the item get added to the flexible range (with the given config options)?
 * The answer is NO.
 * 
 *  - - - - - - -
 * | |x|x|x|x| | |  <-- NO (based on pin & growOptions)
 *  - - - - - - -
 *  0 1 2 3 4 5 6
 * 
 * Because the flexible range is pinned to the beginning, and grows pin side.
 * 
 * Notice that after the insert, the offset remains set at 1.
 * Notice that the answer would be YES if the flexible range was pinned to the end (with the same growOptions).
 * 
 *  - - - - - - - -                 - - - - - - - -

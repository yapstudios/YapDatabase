/**
 * Welcome to YapDatabase!
 *
 * The project page has a wealth of documentation if you have any questions.
 * https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase
 *
 * If you're new to the project you may want to visit the wiki.
 * https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase/wiki
 * 
 * Transactions represent atomic access to a database.
 * There are two types of transactions:
 * - Read-Only transactions
 * - Read-Write transactions
 *
 * Once a transaction is started, all data access within the transaction from that point forward until completion
 * represents an atomic "snapshot" of the current state of the database. For example, if a read-write operation
 * occurs in parallel with a read-only transaction, the read-only transaction won't see the changes made by
 * the read-write operation. But once the read-write operation completes, all transactions started from that point
 * forward will see the changes.
 *
 * You first create and configure a YapDatabase instance.
 * Then you can spawn one or more connections to the database file.
 * Each connection allows you to execute transactions in a serial fashion.
 * For concurrent access, you can create multiple connections,
 * and execute transactions on each connection simulataneously.
 *
 * Concurrency is straight-forward. Here are the rules:
 *
 * - You can have multiple connections.
 * - Every connection is thread-safe.
 * - You can have multiple read-only transactions simultaneously without blocking.
 *   (Each simultaneous transaction would be going through a separate connection.)
 * - You can have multiple read-only transactions and a single read-write transaction simultaneously without blocking.
 *   (Each simultaneous transaction would be going through a separate connection.)
 * - There can only be a single transaction per connection at a time.
 *   (Transactions go through a per-connection serial queue.)
 * - There can only be a single read-write transaction at a time.
 *   (Read-write transactions go through a per-database serial queue.)

#pragma mark Touch

/**
 * You can touch an object if you want to mark it as updated without actually writing any changes to disk.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *   You have a BNBook object in your database.
 *   One of the properties of the book object is a URL pointing to an image for the front cover of the book.
 *   This image gets changed on the server. Thus the UI representation of the book needs to be updated
 *   to reflect the updated image on the server. You realize that all your views are already listening for
 *   YapDatabaseModified notifications, so if you update the object in the database then all your views are
 *   already wired to update the UI appropriately. However, the actual object itself didn't change. So while
 *   there technically isn't any reason to update the object on disk, doing so would be the easiest way to
 *   keep the UI up-to-date. So what you really want is a way to "mark" the object as updated, without actually
 *   incurring the overhead of rewriting it to disk.
 *
 * And this is exactly what the touch methods were designed for.
 * It won't actually cause the object to get rewritten to disk.
 * However, it will mark the object as "updated" within the YapDatabaseModified notification,
 * so any UI components listening for changes will see this object as updated, and can update as appropriate.
 *
 * - touchObjectForKey:inCollection:
 *   Similar to calling replaceObject:forKey:inCollection: and passing the object that already exists.
 *   But without the overhead of fetching the object, or re-writing it to disk.
 *
 * - touchMetadataForKey:inCollection:
 *   Similar to calling replaceMetadata:forKey:inCollection: and passing the metadata that already exists.
 *   But without the overhead of fetching the metadata, or re-writing it to disk.
 * 
 * - touchRowForKey:inCollection:
 *   Similar to calling setObject:forKey:inCollection:withMetadata: and passing the object & metadata the already exist.
 *   But without the overhead of fetching the items, or re-writing them to disk.
 *
 * Note: It is safe to touch items during enumeration.
 * Normally, altering the database while enumerating it will result in an exception (just like altering an array
 * while enumerating it). However, it's safe to touch items during enumeration.
